### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I really liked lab 1 because it was our very first lab. It taught us the 
    basics of GitHub and it was the first time we were able to put our knowledge 
    to use. Finishing the first lab felt really good and put us off to a good start. 

* Lab 6, part 1

    Lab 6 was a very fun lab in my opinion. This lab actually has a lot of real-world 
    use cases which I think makes it even more fun and worthwhile. I like developing 
    code that I can see myself using in real life and I saw that with this lab. 

* Lab 9, part 2

    Lab 9 was also very fun and it had an interesting mechanic. There were 2 players in 
    this game one had to think of the number and the other had to play the game. This lab 
    was really cool because this is definitely something I could see myself making in my free time.
